--- - [ ] (|Utils.time_format|): Initially I think it would be nice to have the 
---       time format inherited from existing timestamps. But I actually know
---       little about parsing time formats in Lua. So here is a ugly
---       implementation using pre-defined patterns to do the so called "inherit"
---       feature. If you know a better way to do this, please open an issue or
---       a PR. Thanks!
